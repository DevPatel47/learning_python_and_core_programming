# learning_python_and_core_programming

This repository contains all the practice exercises I created while learning Python and core programming. It is a personal collection of small scripts and exercises organized by week to help build and reinforce fundamentals.

The `week_1_python_basics` folder (included here) contains simple example scripts that demonstrate basic input/output, conditionals, and functions.

There is also an `interview_questions.md` file that lists interview questions and prompts I've collected and practiced with while preparing for interviews.
